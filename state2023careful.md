Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is a rapidly growing research field that has received a lot of attention during the last few years. An important goal of the field is to use its methods to detect (social) bias and discrimination. Despite these positive intentions, aspects of XAI can be in conflict with feminist approaches and values. Therefore, our conceptual contribution brings forward both a careful assessment of current XAI methods, as well as visions for carefully doing XAI from a feminist perspective. We conclude with a discussion on the possibilities for caring XAI, and the challenges that might lie along the way.
