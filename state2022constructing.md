## Constructing Meaningful Explanations: Logic-based Approaches

Machine learning (ML) models are ubiquitous: we encounter them when using a search engine, behind online text translation, etc. However, these models have to be used with care, as they are susceptible to social biases. Further, most ML models are inherently opaque, another obstacle to understand and verify them.
Being concerned with meaningful explanations, this work is putting forward two research paths: constructing counterfactual explanations with prior knowledge, and reasoning over explanations and time. Prior knowledge has the potential to significantly increase explanation quality, whereas time dimensions are necessary to track changes in ML models and explanations. The proposal builds on (constraint) logic programming and meta-reasoning. While situated in the computer sciences, it strives to reflect the interdisciplinary character of the field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence.
